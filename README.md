# Tool: Mapillary Missing Streets (by type and age)

> A set of tools to generate a list of streets that are missing mapillary street-level imagery, filtered by type (360°) and date (newer than 1.5 years).

## Status

**(!) This is still very much work in progress (!)**

Help is very welcome…

## TODO

- See [JavaScript TODOs](./1-prepare-data/README.md)
- See [QGis TODOs](./2-process-data/README.md)
- Add step 3: Visualize data
- Add step 4: Create routes based on this data; a good starting point for this is https://pretalx.com/fossgis2022/talk/EU8RPG/.
